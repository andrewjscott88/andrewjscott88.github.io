      <p>Please see below for the links to my three favorite projects that I've worked on recently as a student in the Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course with MIT xPRO:</p>

        <a class="project-link" href="https://andrewjscott88.github.io/PacMen-Exercise/"><h2>PacMen Exercise</h2></a>
        <br>
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <br><p>The PacMen factory game allows the user to create PacMen images on-demand that float randomly around the screen.</p>
        <br><p>Here’s how the game is played:</p>
        <br><p>When you click the “Add PacMan” button, a new pacman should appear at a random position on the screen.</p>
        <br><p>When you click the “Start Game” button, the pacman or pacmen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen.</p>
        <br><p>When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.</p>
        <br><p>Future work may include different colors of Pacman or adding in a Ms PacMan.</p>

        <a class="project-link" href="https://andrewjscott88.github.io/Eye-Exercise/"><h2>Eye Exercise</h2></a>
        <br>
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <br><p>The eye movement game allows the user to move the focus of the eye around the screen using the mouse.</p>
        <br><p>As the user moves their mouse cursur around the screen, the eye will track the mouse position and adjust accordingly.</p>
        <br><p>Future work may include blinking the eye using a right-click of the mouse.</p>

        <a class="project-link" href="https://andrewjscott88.github.io/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker/"><h2>Real Time Bus Tracker</h2></a>
        <br>
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <br><p>The Real Time Bus Tracker allows the user to view MBTA bus data to determine stops between Harvard and MIT.</p>
        <br><p>An animated marker shows the stops on the map and highlights the bus route for the user to plan their transportation needed accordingly.</p>
        <br><p>Future work may include adding in real-time traffic data to show any delays in bus schedules.</p>
